# FunProjects
This is just a bundle of codes that I have worked on and have enjoyed
This is kind of for my resume to show what I have done and worked on, but if anyone finds any of the code usefull or entertaining you can take it as well.
I own all the code I have written as my own code written from hand, with prompts I have found online.
